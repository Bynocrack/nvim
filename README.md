# My configuration for nvim
The thing is I have nvim on my pc and on my laptop and I'm tired of doing the same changes on both
so I decided to upload this to a github repository and that way they both que syncronized.

If you want to download this configuration go ahead just keep in mind that you should, at least,
know how to edit it so if anyproblem comes out, yo can fix it
